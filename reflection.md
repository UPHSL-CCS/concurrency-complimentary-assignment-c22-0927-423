**Concurrency in Programming and System Responsiveness**<br>
*Midterm Complimentary Assignment*

Since concurrency is a way for a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time, it improves responsiveness in a program in a way that it can process a lot of tasks at the same time to provide results in one go. The first thing that comes to mind is the use of AI. There are moments and times when I don’t understand a topic in class and I want it to research for me on the internet while I also ask it other questions. The AI can process what I have prompted, look through the internet, compose and answer, and even give a summary of everything in one go or one result instead of doing it task by task, which would take so much more time and effort. 

That alone is already one practice of concurrency, it prevents programs from freezing or being unresponsive. By juggling multiple tasks, it gives us what we need almost immediately, and that is how concurrency helps improve responsiveness. Although tasks seem to run at the same time, and make our work feel faster, it does not always promise speed. It can only manage multiple tasks but does not execute them exactly at the same time, that is rather what we call parallelism. 

Sometimes, concurrency even slows things down for many reasons. One reason is constant switching between tasks, and that switching takes time and if there are many small tasks, the setup and teardown for each one can add up to more time than what you think you are saving. Another reason is dependency between tasks, if one task can’t start until the previous one is finished, then running them concurrently wont speed anything up. Just like my earlier example: I want a summary of everything AI found, but the summary won't happen unless the earlier tasks, like gathering information and such, are done first. Same goes with converting 32°C to Fahrenheit before doing another formula since that formula works for fahrenheit. You really have to wait for the first step before moving on. 

A real-world example where concurrency makes a huge difference is in web browsers. Even if one tab is still loading, I can browse another tab, scroll, type, or watch a video without everything freezing. The browser runs different tasks like loading images, running scripts, downloading data, all at the same time, and that makes the whole experience feel fast and responsive. 

Understanding concurrency helps developers and the system administrators design a system that feel fast even when they are doing heavy background work. It teaches them how to keep programs responsive instead of making the users wait or experience freezing. For example, I bought insurance at GCash from one of their partners. Instead of it crashing or providing null values, since the data haven't been fetched yet, it can display a loading screen while it is fetching. Making the user feel comfortable that everything runs smoothly without any errors. Good use of concurrency improves user experience by making things run smoothly, which is something we expect from modern applications today.
